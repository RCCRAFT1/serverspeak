# serverspeak
Make your server talk back!

This AI will interface with your minecraft server as a plugin.
Main program is built in python, kind of like a virtual assistant.

System Requirements:
A NVIDIA GPU w/ CUDA (GTX 1070 or higher is recommended),
A Windows/linux machine with Anaconda and Python 3.8 installed,
At least 10gb of allocated cache storage,
At least 16gb of RAM (32gb is recommended),

# How much of my GPU is being used?
When the program is at idle: it will use at least 5% of your gpu.
When the program is processing requests: it will use at least 20% of your gpu
When the program is in benchmark mode, it will use at least 80% of your gpu.

# How to Run the Program
When the plugin is installed, run the main py files, and it should start the webserver/idle process. If new hardware is detected, it will run Benchmark mode.
