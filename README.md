# serverspeak
Make your server talk back!

This AI will interface with your minecraft server as a plugin.
Main program is built in python, kind of like a virtual assistant.
NOTE: This program is untrained and needs to be trained before use.

System Requirements:
A NVIDIA GPU w/ CUDA (GTX 1070 or higher is recommended),
A Windows/linux machine with Anaconda and Python 3.8 installed,
At least 10gb of allocated cache storage,
At least 16gb of RAM (32gb is recommended),

# Updates
2/16/2021: Added failure to find command <br> 2/14/2021: I've fixed a major bug with math enumerating character values. <br> 2/17/2021: Added timetable


# Libraries
ServerSpeak uses multiple libraries that you might have to install, such as
pytorch and playground.docker (DOCKER CAN BE OBTAINED HERE:(COMING SOON)) 
NOTE THAT THIS PROGRAM USES mPALF. PLEASE INSTALL IT HERE:


# How much of my GPU is being used?
When the program is at idle: it will use at least 5% of your gpu.
When the program is processing requests: it will use at least 20% of your gpu
When the program is in benchmark mode, it will use at least 80% of your gpu.

# How to Run the Program
When the plugin is installed, run the main py files, and it should start the webserver/idle process. If new hardware is detected, it will run Benchmark mode.
# How to run on linux
